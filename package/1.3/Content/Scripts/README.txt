A jQuery Plugin for adding IE9 features (site pinning, site mode, etc.) to your websites.

== Description ==

A jQuery Plugin for adding IE9 features (site pinning, site mode, etc.) to your websites. Several new features of Internet Explorer 9 are designed to enhance the browsing experience of consumers by enabling sites that leverage certain features to behave like applications on the desktop when those sites are ‘pinned’ to the taskbar in Windows 7. A user pins a site by dragging the site’s tab (or favicon in the address bar) to the taskbar. For all sites, IE9 will create a default experience (called ‘site mode’) that will use information about the site to create an instance of the browser customized to look specific to that site. Developers can also add specific meta tags and script commands to extend these features to further customize user’s pinned experience of the site.

The purpose of the pinify jQuery plugin is to enable developers to safely leverage IE9 side mode features with simple commands and no need for additional browser checks. To view the full documentation, click here, or on the Documentation tab above. For more information about site pinning, and for a whirlwind walkthrough of pinify, check out Brandon Satrom's blog post "Applify Your Sites with Pinned Site and ie9ify, the IE9 jQuery Plugin."

To install the pinify plugin, use NuGet (http://nuget.org/List/Packages/jQuery.ie9ify) or download the source directly from here or the plugins.jquery.com (http://plugins.jquery.com/project/pinify). Note: NuGet package will be changed from jquery.ie9ify to jquery.pinify in the near future.

	jquery.ie9ify.css ==> jquery.pinify.css
	$(*).ie9ify(); ==> $(*).pinify();
Also, users upgrading from 1.1 to 1.2 via NuGet should know that the old jquery.ie9ify.* files will remain and should be removed

* Modified ready handler in sample and qunit tests
* Upgraded to jQuery 1.5.2
* Created build PowerShell script to auto-minify jquery.ie9ify.js (using yuicompressor) and move to the sample/js and root js folders.
* Completed build, package and push scripts to: 1)auto-version and timestamp the ie9ify js file, 2) minify .js and .css, 3) create a zip archive for Codeplex releases, 4) create a NuGet package and 5) deploy the package to NuGet.org

* Implemented Thumbbar buttons style support in $.ie9ify.createThumbbarButtons() through a new property called alternateStyle. Modified sample to include example of thumbbar buttons with alternate styling.
* [BREAKING CHANGE] Deprecated the mainContentSelector option in pinTeaser. Use the topHat teaser type if you need to move your page down to fit in a teaser
* [BREAKING CHANGE] Moved pinTeaser options linkText, linkColor, backgroundColor and textColor into a container "style" option. You can now use style: { linkText: ... }

These new types require the .css stylesheet introduced in this version and images contained in the 'images' directory.
